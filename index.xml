      <description>Background Story Back in April 2021, I haven’t got any job yet after graduating from Vocational High School. By the end of the month, I found a really interesting post on LinkedIn which stated that Yayasan Anak Bangsa Bisa (under Gojek) is opening a program called Generasi GIGIH. Generasi GIGIH was addressed for those who have graduated high school, university, or a final year university student.

I usually use VS Code and Android Studio as my main tools for developing mobile apps. It works just fine with Ubuntu, for a short amount of time until I changed my mind.
Now, about my main Operating System. Since the first time I have a laptop, I have already used Windows for the OS.</description>

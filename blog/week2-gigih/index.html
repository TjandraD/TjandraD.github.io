<div class="container markdown top-pad">
    <p>This post is dedicated as a reflection of my experience in the 2nd week in the Generasi GIGIH- Intermediate Level program. I have spent the last two weeks learning Ruby &amp; MySQL within Generasi GIGIH.</p>
<p>While the first week is mostly about Ruby and OOP, the second week dive deeper into database, ERD, and SQL. In the second week, the mentors taught us about HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc), Entity Relational Diagram (ERD), and MySQL database.</p>

<h1 id="past-present-and-future" class="anchor-link"><a href="#past-present-and-future">Past, Present, and Future</a></h1>
<p>How well do I know the materials before the mentoring sessions? How do I feel about the work that week? And how can I use the knowledge I earned in the future?</p>

<h2 id="past-how-well-do-i-know-about-the-materials-before" class="anchor-link"><a href="#past-how-well-do-i-know-about-the-materials-before">Past: How well do I know about the materials before?</a></h2>
<p>Well, in the Beginner Level of this program. We, the students, are given access to learn Ruby and MySQL in Progate (an online learning platform focusing on programming skills). So, I can say that I am already familiar enough with the syntax of both Ruby and MySQL.</p>
<p>For Ruby, I used it several times to solve the Hackerrank problems. And for MySQL, I have used it for my side projects. Even though that my side projects use SQLite, but the syntax is quite the same.</p>

<h2 id="present-how-do-i-feel-about-the-work-in-the-2nd-week" class="anchor-link"><a href="#present-how-do-i-feel-about-the-work-in-the-2nd-week">Present: How do I feel about the work in the 2nd week?</a></h2>
<p>Well, to be honest, this week&rsquo;s sessions are better than the previous week. The sessions are quite fun, and it is very interactive between the mentors and the students.</p>
<p>But, we only got homework in the last session. We don&rsquo;t get homework for the first and second sessions that week. I&rsquo;d prefer to have homework in the first and second sessions because there will be a review session in the next meeting. And if we&rsquo;re having a review session for our homework, we could get direct input about our code from the mentors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I enjoyed those sessions. The explanation is crystal clear, I could understand the information very easily. They don&rsquo;t need to repeat what they have explained to us before.</p>

<h2 id="future-how-can-i-use-the-knowledge-in-the-future" class="anchor-link"><a href="#future-how-can-i-use-the-knowledge-in-the-future">Future: How can I use the knowledge in the future?</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to use those skills that I have earned (Ruby &amp; MySQL) since I would like to expand my skill set. Right now, I&rsquo;m a Mobile Apps Developer, and I could use those skills if I wanted to make a jump in my career into Backend or Full Stack.</p>
<p>I also have some side projects in mind, that I would like to use Ruby and MySQL for the backend side.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s just it for the second week&rsquo;s reflection. Hope you guys enjoy this article, and perhaps I&rsquo;ll post another article like this in the future.</p>

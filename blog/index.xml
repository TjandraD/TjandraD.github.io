      <description>This post is dedicated as a reflection of my experience in the 2nd week in the Generasi GIGIH- Intermediate Level program. I have spent the last two weeks learning Ruby &amp;amp; MySQL within Generasi GIGIH.
While the first week is mostly about Ruby and OOP, the second week dive deeper into database, ERD, and SQL. In the second week, the mentors taught us about HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc), Entity Relational Diagram (ERD), and MySQL database.</description>

      <description>Background Story Back in April 2021, I haven’t got any job yet after graduating from Vocational High School. By the end of the month, I found a really interesting post on LinkedIn which stated that Yayasan Anak Bangsa Bisa (under Gojek) is opening a program called Generasi GIGIH. Generasi GIGIH was addressed for those who have graduated high school, university, or a final year university student. They gave us 3 main learning path, which is: Backend Engineering, Frontend Engineering, and Data Analyst path.</description>

      <description>First of all, let me give you a little background about myself. I am a Software Engineer Student, mainly focused on working with mobile applications using Flutter. I usually use VS Code and Android Studio as my main tools for developing mobile apps. It works just fine with Ubuntu, for a short amount of time until I changed my mind.
Now, about my main Operating System. Since the first time I have a laptop, I have already used Windows for the OS.</description>
